# **Project: Analyzing Income Patterns and Socioeconomic Factors to Find Donors for Charity**
## **Problem**
In this project, we will apply explainatory data analysis and machine learning algorithms to accurately identify the individuals income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. we will choose the best algorithm by comparing results and try to optimize that algorithm to best model the data. Our goal is to construct a model that can predicts whether and idividual makes more than $50,000. This can help funding organizations that survive on donations, understanding an individual income can help idenfity the quantity of donation to request.\n"
